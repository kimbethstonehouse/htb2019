# things I have not yet managed to do
# 0. compare rent with average house prices - suggest hey you could be paying less
# 1. calculate income decile from salary - need Anu's help idk
# 2. can't find any data on occupation
# 3. currently just calculating the cost of one person and multiplying by 0.7 to account
# for each child dependent (or just 1 for adult) - maybe need a better scale factor, speak to Anu, see line 79
# 4. can't find data  on student vs part time vs full time - maybe we need to weight the data
# such as increase budget for alcohol if student, etc
